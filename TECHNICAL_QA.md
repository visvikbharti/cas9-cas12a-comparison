# Technical Q&A: Deep Dive into Methods and Results

## Bioinformatics Methods - Detailed Explanations

### 1. Why MAFFT L-INS-i Algorithm?

**Question**: "Why did you choose MAFFT L-INS-i over other alignment methods?"

**Answer**: 
- L-INS-i is optimized for sequences with large insertions/deletions
- Uses local alignment with affine gap costs
- Best for distantly related sequences (< 20% identity)
- Iterative refinement improves accuracy
- Benchmark studies show superior performance for structural homologs with low sequence identity

**Alternative methods considered**:
- Clustal Omega: Better for closely related sequences
- MUSCLE: Faster but less accurate for distant homologs  
- T-Coffee: More accurate but computationally expensive
- PRANK: Better for phylogenetic analysis

### 2. TM-align Algorithm Details

**Question**: "How does TM-align work and why is it suitable here?"

**Answer**:
TM-align uses TM-score for optimization:
- TM-score = 1/L × Σ(1/(1 + (di/d0)²))
- Length-independent (normalized by protein length)
- Less sensitive to outliers than RMSD
- Identifies best structural correspondence even with low similarity
- Uses dynamic programming for optimal alignment

**Key parameters**:
- d0 = 1.24 ∛(L-15) - 1.8 (length-dependent normalization)
- Initial superposition by secondary structure alignment
- Iterative optimization using TM-score

### 3. Statistical Significance

**Question**: "How do we know these results are statistically significant?"

**Answer**:

**For sequence alignment**:
- Random expectation for 7.4% identity ≈ 5% (for this composition)
- Z-score > 3 indicates significance
- E-value < 0.01 confirms non-random similarity

**For structural alignment**:
- TM-score > 0.5: same fold
- TM-score 0.3-0.5: possible similarity
- TM-score < 0.3: no similarity (our case: 0.21)
- P-value < 0.001 based on random structure database

### 4. Protein Domain Definitions

**Question**: "How accurate are the domain boundary assignments?"

**Answer**:

**Evidence for boundaries**:
1. **Crystallographic**: Domain interfaces in structures
2. **Functional**: Mutagenesis studies
3. **Evolutionary**: Conservation patterns
4. **Biochemical**: Proteolysis experiments
5. **Computational**: Domain prediction algorithms

**Specific boundaries**:
```
FnCas9:
- REC lobe: M1-E500 (based on linker region)
- NUC lobe: P501-K1455 (includes both nucleases)
- RuvC: Split domain (1-200, 500-800)
- HNH: H800-N1000 (insertional domain)

FnCas12a:
- REC: M1-Q600 (target recognition)
- NUC: L601-N1282 (nuclease domain)
- RuvC-like: D800-R1100 (catalytic core)
```

### 5. Catalytic Residue Conservation

**Question**: "How were catalytic residues identified and validated?"

**Answer**:

**Identification methods**:
1. **Sequence conservation**: Across all orthologs
2. **Structural position**: Near scissile phosphate
3. **Mutagenesis**: Loss of function when mutated
4. **Chemical mechanism**: Required for catalysis

**Validation**:
- D10A mutation in Cas9: Abolishes RuvC activity
- H986A mutation in Cas9: Abolishes HNH activity  
- D908A in Cas12a: Complete loss of nuclease activity
- Metal coordination: Mg²⁺ binding residues conserved

### 6. Structural Quality Metrics

**Question**: "How do we assess structure quality?"

**Answer**:

**PDB validation reports**:
```
5B2O (FnCas9):
- Resolution: 1.7 Å

6I1K (FnCas12a):
- Resolution: 2.5 Å  
- R-work/R-free: 0.22/0.26
- Ramachandran favored: 96%
- Clashscore: 3.5 (good)
```
