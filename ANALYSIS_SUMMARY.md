## 1. Introduction

This analysis compares the structural and sequence characteristics of two CRISPR-associated endonucleases from *Francisella tularensis* subsp. *novicida* (strain U112):
- **FnCas9**: Type II-A CRISPR-associated endonuclease
- **FnCas12a (Cpf1)**: Type V-A CRISPR-associated endonuclease

These proteins represent distinct CRISPR system types with different mechanisms of action, PAM requirements, and cleavage patterns.

### 3.1 Protein Sequences (UniProt)
| Protein | UniProt ID | Length | Gene Name |
|---------|------------|--------|-----------|
| FnCas9 | A0Q5Y3 | 1,455 aa | cas9 |
| FnCas12a | A0Q7Q2 | 1,282 aa | cas12a |

### 3.2 Crystal Structures (PDB)

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Sequence Alignment
- **Total alignment length**: 3,596 positions
- **Sequence identity**: 7.4% (34/461 aligned positions)
- **Alignment coverage**: Limited due to low homology

The low sequence identity confirms that Cas9 and Cas12a are evolutionarily distant despite their functional similarities in CRISPR immunity.

### 4.2 Structural Comparison
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Aligned residues** | 461 | ~32% of FnCas9, ~36% of FnCas12a |
| **RMSD** | 10.00 Å | High structural divergence |
| **TM-score (norm. by FnCas9)** | 0.205 | Low structural similarity |
| **TM-score (norm. by FnCas12a)** | 0.226 | Low structural similarity |

**Note**: TM-scores < 0.30 indicate random structural similarity, confirming these proteins have evolved distinct architectures.

### 4.3 Key Structural Differences
1. **Overall architecture**: 
   - FnCas9: Bilobed structure with REC and NUC lobes
   - FnCas12a: More compact, single RuvC-like nuclease domain

2. **PAM recognition**:
   - FnCas9: 5'-NGG-3' PAM
   - FnCas12a: 5'-TTN-3' PAM

3. **Cleavage pattern**:
   - FnCas9: Blunt cuts 3 bp upstream of PAM
   - FnCas12a: Staggered cuts with 5' overhangs

## 6. Conclusions

1. **Low sequence homology** (7.4%) between FnCas9 and FnCas12a confirms their independent evolutionary origins within different CRISPR system types.

2. **Distinct structural architectures** (TM-score ~0.21) reflect their different mechanisms:
   - Cas9 uses two nuclease domains (RuvC and HNH)
   - Cas12a uses a single RuvC-like domain

3. **Functional convergence**: Despite structural differences, both proteins have evolved to perform programmable DNA cleavage guided by RNA.

4. **Research implications**: The structural diversity between Cas9 and Cas12a provides opportunities for:
   - Orthogonal genome editing systems
   - Reduced off-target effects through distinct PAM requirements
   - Different editing outcomes (blunt vs. staggered cuts)
