## 3. Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Why did you choose these specific proteins?"
**A**: FnCas9 and FnCas12a represent two major CRISPR system types (II-A and V-A) from the same organism (*Francisella novicida*), allowing direct comparison without species-specific variations. Both have high-resolution crystal structures available (1.7 Å and 2.5 Å).

### Q2: "What's the biological significance of the low sequence identity?"
**A**: The 7.4% identity indicates these proteins evolved independently to perform similar functions. This is a classic example of convergent evolution - different protein scaffolds achieving the same outcome (programmable DNA cleavage).

### Q3: "How reliable is the structural alignment with such low similarity?"
**A**: TM-align is specifically designed for distant homologs. While the overall TM-score (0.21) indicates low similarity, the algorithm identifies the best structural correspondence. The 461 aligned positions represent structurally equivalent regions, primarily in the core catalytic domains.

### Q4: "What are the functional implications of these structural differences?"
**A**: 
- **PAM recognition**: Different structures = different PAM sequences (NGG vs TTN)
- **Cleavage pattern**: Cas9 makes blunt cuts, Cas12a makes staggered cuts
- **Guide RNA**: Different RNA scaffolds and binding modes
- **Off-target effects**: Different specificity profiles

### Q5: "Why is the RMSD so high (10 Å)?"
**A**: RMSD measures average atomic displacement. 10 Å indicates significant structural divergence. For comparison:
- Closely related proteins: RMSD < 2 Å
- Same fold family: RMSD 2-5 Å  
- Different folds: RMSD > 5 Å

Our proteins fall in the "different folds" category.

### Q6: "How did you determine domain boundaries?"
**A**: Based on published literature:
- FnCas9 domains from Hirano et al. (2016) Science
- FnCas12a domains from Swarts & Jinek (2018) Nature
- Validated by secondary structure analysis and functional studies

### Q7: "What software/methods did you use?"
**A**: 
- **Alignment**: MAFFT v7.520 (L-INS-i algorithm)
- **Structure**: TM-align (optimal for distant homologs)
- **Visualization**: PyMOL 2.5 (ray-traced at 900 DPI)
- **Pipeline**: Snakemake (reproducible workflow)
- **Environments**: Conda (version-controlled)

### Q8: "Can we trust the active site identification?"
**A**: Yes, the catalytic residues are well-characterized:
- **Cas9**: D10, D840, H863, N866 (RuvC); H986 (HNH)
- **Cas12a**: D908, E911, D1226 (RuvC-like)
These are conserved across orthologs and confirmed by mutagenesis.

### Q9: "What's the evolutionary relationship?"
**A**: No direct evolutionary relationship. These represent:
- Different CRISPR system types (Type II vs Type V)
- Different domain organizations
- Likely acquired by *F. novicida* through separate horizontal gene transfer events

### Q10: "How does this compare to SpCas9 or other variants?"
**A**: FnCas9 is larger than SpCas9 (1,455 vs 1,368 aa) but shares the same architecture. The comparison to FnCas12a shows greater divergence than between Cas9 orthologs.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Concerns

### "The alignment looks poor"
**Response**: "That's exactly the point - these proteins achieve similar functions through completely different sequences. The 7.4% identity is actually higher than random chance, indicating some conservation in critical regions."

### "Why not use AlphaFold?"
**Response**: "We used experimentally determined crystal structures for accuracy. AlphaFold predictions could be a future validation step."

### "The colors are hard to distinguish"
**Response**: "We used colorblind-friendly palette (red/blue). We can generate alternative color schemes if needed."
